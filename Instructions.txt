First, run Install.bat by double clicking on it.

Second, you should go to your Half-Life install directory (usually it is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life\valve\") and edit the things under [Change to Your Liking]

If Install.bat doesn't work, put the Rinput and Valve folders into \Half-Life\valve\ and put the Half-Life shortcut on your desktop
