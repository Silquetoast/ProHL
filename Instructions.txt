(Start by making sure you take all of these files out of the .zip file and place
them in a folder on your desktop. you can delete them after running install.bat)


First, run Install.bat by double clicking on it.

Second, you should go to your Half-Life install directory (usually it is
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life\valve\") and edit the
things under [Change to Your Liking]

Lastly, make sure to launch Half-Life through the shortcut that the installer
put on your desktop so that rinput can run. (That's the program that makes your
mouse more responsive). If you don't use the icon it won't run with rinput and
your mouse will probably feel less responsive.


If Install.bat doesn't work, put the Rinput and Valve folders into
\steamapps\common\Half-Life\ and put the Half-Life shortcut on your desktop
