First, run Install.bat by double clicking on it.

Second, you should go to your Half-Life install directory (usually it is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life\valve\") and edit the things under [Change to Your Liking]

Lastly, make sure to launch Half-Life through the shortcut that the installer put on your desktop so that rinput can run. (That's the program that makes your mouse more responsive)
If you dont use the icon it won't run with rinput and your mouse will probably feel less responsive.


If Install.bat doesn't work, put the Rinput and Valve folders into \Half-Life\valve\ and put the Half-Life shortcut on your desktop
