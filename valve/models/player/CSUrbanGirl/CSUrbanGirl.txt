Description             : Converted Model for Half-Life DM
=============================================================================

This is converted Counter Strike Model (one of a complete set).

Basically I updated the animations.

All the compiling and decompiling was done in Milkshape 1.6.5

The total modification took about 1 hour from start to finish,
most of the time was checking the animations and mesh.

Info:

Files included:
CSUrbanGirl.mdl - The HLDM player version of the game CSUrbanGirl model file
CSUrbanGirl.bmp - The picture you see when selecting the model in the game
CSUrbanGirl.txt - This text file

Place CSUrbanGirl.mdl, CSUrbanGirl.bmp, CSUrbanGirl.jpg and CSUrbanGirl.txt in a
new folder called CSUrbanGirl, in valve\models\player folder in your Half
Life directory.

** IMPORTANT NOTICE **
This model should NOT be distributed in any kind of commercial
compilation, product or package without my personal approval.

This model CAN otherwise be distributed freely as long as this text
file is included, unmodified, with the package.

And PLEASE don't extract the skin and draw a mustache or remove the
clothes from it and release it to the world as yours, don't be lame.
(thanks to NSi for the notice).
