This is my very first attempt at skinning and I hope that I have
done justice to my favorite Marvel Comics character.

Software used : Paint Shop Pro 6 and Half-Life Model Viewer v1.24

Enjoy!

Thanks to Brian "EvilBastard" Collins for his great model, Jeff
Potvin (aka Bad-Aim) for his inspiration, Marvel Comics and, of
course, Valve Software for my all-time favorite time-killer.
