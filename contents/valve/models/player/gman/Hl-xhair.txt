     Replace the crosshairs.spr file inside your sprites folder with this one.   The sprites folder is inside your valve folder inside the halflife folder,  which is inside whatever folder you installed the game.  I think the default was Sierra.  So it might look like this:

    C:\Sierra\half-life\valve\sprites\crosshairs.spr

     These crosshairs were created by Lee 'Foxtrot9' Raven    

     No more disappearing crosshair in the middle of battling a chopper!
