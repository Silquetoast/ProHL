All Credit Due          : to Gabor for creating this great Model
=============================================================================

This is a Counter Strike Hostage Model that I've converted to be a full
HLDM player model.

Basically I put in a new skeleton and animations, but I had to edit some of
the mesh to eliminate some really really weird arm and shoulderblade
distortion thingies.

I finally got all the misc things fixed including a missing triangle under
her chin and the odd tearing of her skirt in crouched animation.

All the compiling and decompiling was done in Milkshape 1.6.5.

The total modification took about 4 hour from start to finish, but there some
time spent over several months of tinkering to try and understand what the
bizarre problem was with the HLDM animations. Some amount of time was spent
checking the animations and mesh.

All in all a real nice model!
