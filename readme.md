# BEFORE YOU USE:

It is VERY important for you to note that this package will replace your **crosshairs** and **binds**. However, your binds will be backed up to backup.cfg on your desktop.

If you don't want your crosshairs to be replaced, delete crosshairs.spr in \ProHL\valve\sprites\ before running Install.bat

If you want to make any personal changes to my binds, you should add/change them in both ProHL.cfg *and* plus.cfg. I highly recommend you use mine, though, because they are carefully placed and crucial to a fast play-style.


## INSTALLATION:

- **STEP 1:** Download the package **[here](https://github.com/Silquetoast/ProHL/releases/download/v1.3/ProHL.exe)**

- **STEP 2:** Double click Install.bat! 

Be sure to change your sensitivity and stuff in prohl.cfg the `[Change to Your Liking]` section! Just edit the file with Notepad.

If your Half-Life installation isn't the default Steam directory on the C drive, just move everything in "contents" to your HL installation (for Steam, it should be "Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life\"). Then you'll need to put the Half-Life shortcut on your desktop.


## What do these files do?

First, the installer will add rinput.exe to your installation. This program, which only runs when you use the shortcut added to your desktop, will make your mouse VERY responsive. The installer will also add a LOT of models for you to use and new crosshairs that are built for visibility. 

The config itself adds the following:
 - hard weapon binds (i.e. f = crossbow, 4 = shotgun, etc.)
 - mousewheel down to jump (for bunnyhopping)
 - mousewheel up to slide (rapid ducking preserves momentum on the ground)
 - uncapped framerate
 
The following are optional settings that have to be toggled with the [ and ] keys:
 - hold-to-equip weapon binds (when you let go of the key, you'll go to last weapon) [broken]
 - shotgun bind will equip any other weapon if you don't have a shotgun
 - pressing f will force the crossbow to unzoom (This only effects your vision and does not let you shoot faster. If you TRY to shoot faster, a projectile explosive will fire instead.)
