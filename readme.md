# BEFORE YOU USE:

It is VERY important for you to note that this package will replace your **crosshairs** and **binds**. 

If you don't want your crosshairs to be replaced, delete crosshairs.spr in \ProHL\valve\sprites\ before running Install.bat

If you want to make any personal changes to my binds, you should add/change them in both ProHL.cfg *and* plus.cfg. I highly recommend you use mine, though, because a lot of them are carefully placed and crucial to a fast play-style. (Regardless, you should backup your binds before you use prohl.cfg)


## INSTALLATION:

Download the package [here](https://github.com/Silquetoast/ProHL/releases/download/v1.3/ProHL.exe)

All you gotta do is double click Install.bat! If Install.bat doesn't work, move everything in "contents" to your HL installation (for Steam, it should be "\steamapps\common\Half-Life\"). Then you'll need to put the Half-Life shortcut on your desktop.

Be sure to change your sensitivity and stuff in prohl.cfg the "[Change to Your Liking]" section! Just edit the file with Notepad.


## What can these files do for you?

First and foremost, prohl.cfg will give you binds that are crucial to quick gameplay(like instant weapon swaps and forced unscope binds). It will take some getting used to and some keys will seem out of place, but trust me these binds are very efficient. If you make an effort to learn the keys you WILL see improvement.

Secondly, prohl.cfg will also adjust some settings that will hopefully increase your framerate and change some settings that only hold you back.

Probably most importantly, I included rinput.exe and made a .bat file that will run Half-Life with it automatically. Rinput will, in short, make your mouse extremely responsive, which is crucial to playing quickly and accurately. Just put the icon included in the base folder onto your desktop and use it to launch Half-Life from now on.

On the side: This package will also give you new crosshairs(ones that stand out more than the orange ones) and some models just for the heck of it. The models may not sound important but they can be used as camo if you use them right. (Tbh, it's just a pretty dang good collection and I wanted to include them :)
