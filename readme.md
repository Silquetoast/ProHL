## INSTALLATION:

- **STEP 1:** Download the package **[here](https://github.com/Silquetoast/ProHL/releases/latest)** and extract to your desktop(or somewhere convenient to get to).

- **STEP 2:** Move everything in the "contents" folder to your HL installation (for Steam, it should be `Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life\`) except for the shortcut for HL, which should go on your desktop or somewhere easy to access. (if you don't use the shortcut to run the game, rinput will not activate)

- **STEP 2 Alt:** You can also double click Install.bat to handle the file moving automatically (for Steam only, can be finicky)

Be sure to change your sensitivity and stuff in prohl.cfg the `[Change to Your Liking]` section! Just edit the file with Notepad or Notepad++.


## What do these files do?

The package includes an icon for your desktop for Half-Life. It'll launch Half-Life with rinput.exe for the most responsive mouse movement you've ever experienced. It also contains lots of optional models and VERY visible crosshairs. (***Note:*** The installer will replace your crosshairs and binds!)

The config itself adds the following:
 - hard weapon binds (i.e. f = crossbow, 4 = shotgun, etc.)
 - mousewheel-down to jump (for bunnyhopping)
 - mousewheel-up to slide (rapid ducking preserves momentum on the ground)
 - uncapped framerate
 - increased crosshair visibility
 
The following are optional settings that have to be toggled on/off with the [ and ] keys:
 - hold-to-equip weapon binds (when you let go of the key, you'll go to last weapon) [broken]
 - shotgun bind will equip any other weapon if you don't have a shotgun
 - pressing f will force the crossbow to unzoom (This only effects your vision and does not let you shoot faster. This can be done manually by pressing any weapon bind and F immediately after)

My config does **not** add scripts for gauss movement, bunnyhopping, longjumping, or quick crossbow shots. Learning to do these things manually is better because you'll have more control and more room for more useful binds.
