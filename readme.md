# BEFORE YOU USE:

It is VERY important for you to note that this package will replace your **crosshairs** and **binds**. 

If you don't want your crosshairs to be replaced, delete crosshairs.spr in \ProHL\valve\sprites\ before running Install.bat

If you want to make any personal changes to my binds, you should add/change them in both ProHL.cfg *and* plus.cfg. I highly recommend you use mine, though, because they are carefully placed and crucial to a fast play-style. (Regardless, you should backup your binds before you use prohl.cfg)


## INSTALLATION:

Download the package **[here](https://github.com/Silquetoast/ProHL/releases/download/v1.3/ProHL.exe)**

All you have to do is double click Install.bat! If Install.bat doesn't work(or if your Half-Life installation isn't the default C drive Steam directory), move everything in "contents" to your HL installation (for Steam, it should be "\steamapps\common\Half-Life\"). Then you'll need to put the Half-Life shortcut on your desktop.

Be sure to change your sensitivity and stuff in prohl.cfg the `[Change to Your Liking]` section! Just edit the file with Notepad.


## What can these files do for you?

The config file will give you completely new binds, which will help promote fast gameplay by giving you the ability to switch weapons quickly and more comfortably. The binds also move the jump button to mouse scroll down. This is so you can bunnyhop easier and more consistently. These binds will feel weird at first but if you get used to it you'll see a payoff. 

It will also change some settings such as net_graph (so you can monitor server/client lag), default_fov(field of vision, it lets you see more), weapon bob, max FPS, rates, mouse options, and some misc settings. 

This pack includes a scripted version of the .cfg, which can be managed using these keys:

`[ = Deactivate scripts`

`] = Activate scripts`

`\ = Re-run unscripted .cfg`

The scripted version of the .cfg will give you the following abilities:
- Increment the following using arrow keys: FPS, volume, mwheelup function
- Shotgun bind will pull out the next best weapon if the shotgun isn't available
- Force crossbow to unzoom when the crossbow bind is pressed(note: this doesn't have any advantage over switching weapons manually, as manually offers more control)

I have kept my "scripts" to a minimum because in every case(including gauss movement, longjumps and bunnyhopping) doing things manually and legitimately is always better. You will not find scripts of that kind in my config. If you want to learn to bhop, longjump or move with gauss better, do it yourself rather than through scripts.
